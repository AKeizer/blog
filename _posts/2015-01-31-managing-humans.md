    This is the first in a series of notes/cribsheets for various career oriented books.

## What Managers Do

# Managers

- What's their career background?
- What weaknesses to they have to compensate for?
- Do they meet with you often?
- Do they make things happen?
- How do they handle a crisis?

# Take Aways

- Don't be a prick
- Prioritize one on ones
