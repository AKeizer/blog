Hi there. 

So I started a blog. As a disclaimer for you, the reader, I want to let you know that I do not claim to be an expert, nor am I a wordsmith. 
What I am is a student. A student of Software Engineering to be exact. And so I'm going to be giving that perspective here on this blog.

You've been warned. 

Content of this blog will usually be related to topics that I am working on at the time. They will usually be something that I had trouble with 
or that I feel like talking about. 

FYI Source code for this blog came from Chase Seibert's blog repository on GitHub [and here is the link](https://github.com/chase-seibert/blog)
